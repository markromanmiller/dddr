#' Vector projection and rejection
#'
#' Oftentimes it is useful to constrain a vector to lie on a line or a plane.
#' Vector projection and rejection is able to do these operations. Projection
#' reduces all vectors to lie on the line of the vector given, and rejection
#' reduces all vectors to lie on the place normal the the specified vector.
#'
#' @param x Vectors to project or reject
#' @param onto,from The vector to project onto or reject from

  # random thought: if speed is an issue, it may make sense to add classes to
  # the vector3s saying if they've already been normalized, etc.

#' Extend a point and direction towards a target plane.

#' where a peron was looking or where an object was pointing over the course of
#' time or sessions.
#'
#' @param initial Starting point for the ray
#' @param direction Direction from which to cast the ray
#' @param target_normal,target_point Define the plane that will catch the rays
#' @param include_backwards Whether to include rays that travel backwards from
#'   `initial` along `direction` to the target plane.
